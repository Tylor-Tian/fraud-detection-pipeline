## Style Guide

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these additional guidelines:

* Line length: 100 characters
* Use type hints where possible
* Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
* Use meaningful variable names

### Code Formatting

We use `black` for code formatting and `isort` for import sorting:

```bash
black fraud_detection/
isort fraud_detection/
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add fraud detection rule for velocity checks

- Implement velocity checking across time windows
- Add configuration for velocity thresholds
- Include tests for edge cases

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=fraud_detection

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

* Write tests for all new functionality
* Maintain test coverage above 80%
* Use descriptive test names
* Include both positive and negative test cases
* Mock external dependencies

Example test:
```python
def test_process_transaction_with_high_amount():
    """Test that high amount transactions are flagged correctly."""
    detector = FraudDetectionSystem()
    transaction = Transaction(
        transaction_id="TEST001",
        amount=15000,  # High amount
        # ... other fields
    )
    
    result = detector.process_transaction(transaction)
    
    assert result.is_fraud is True
    assert "HIGH_AMOUNT" in result.flags
```

## Documentation

* Update the README.md if needed
* Add docstrings to all public APIs
* Update the docs/ folder for significant changes
* Include examples in documentation

## Release Process

1. Update version in `setup.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
5. GitHub Actions will handle the rest
